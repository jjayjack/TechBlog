## Description:
  This application is set up to be a mini forum for users to create their own posts to which they can edit, delete and comment on and view and reply on other user's posts. During this process, I learned more about applying the CRUD model to multiple applications and routes, the usefulness of handlebars, and connecting controllers to created database and client requests.

## Installation:
  To install, ensure that all dependencies are available locally. This includes npm, path, express, express-handlebars, express-sesson, dotenv and connect-session-sequelize. Next, create a new .env file to contain your login information for your SQL application then create a new config/connection file to connect to your credentials to SQL. From there create a new database based on the SQL schema file.  

## Usage:
  To start up the application, using the terminal start up the server then load the local host within a browser. In order for the user to input or view all information, they must have a valid login.
